#### WellDone

WellDone is an NPO that oversees the functioning of water pumps in TZ, with the effort to make communities there self-reliant. They have a sensor called MoMo that attaches itself to water pumps and transmits key data to a server. This data is then used to automate reporting of pump health and provide analytical insights.

In this app, we addressed the needs of local water pump engineers to bring the app with them to their field, view and get notified of the changes in healths of the pumps, provide updates once they fix issues, possibly navigate to other pumps, view the lay of the land, and do all of these without network availability.

Key Features:

 - Log in with username and password
 - View list of pumps along with status and priority, location, distance from logged-in user, last updated time, etc.
 - Sort by distance, priority, last updated
 - View pumps on a map
 - Swipe between pumps on map view
 - Create a new report with a pump along with a new photo
 - Navigate to next pump after creating a report
 - Offline mode: all changes to data are locally cached, by default. In the event of no network coverage, these changes sit in the cache and wait to be sent to the server. Once network becomes available, they are sent to the server and other users can pull down to view the latest data. Itâ€™s alright for the app to be killed in the meantime.
 - Pull down to refresh data (fetches new data from server)
