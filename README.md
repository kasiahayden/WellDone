#### WellDone

WellDone is a non-profit organization that oversees the functioning of water pumps in Tanzania, with the effort to make communities there self-reliant. There are many organizations building wells, but often they end up neglected and eventually break down. WellDone integrates mobile monitoring systems into pumps called MoMoâ€™s. They gather information about pumps, wirelessly transmitting the data back to WellDone. WellDone and it's monitors stand out as a way to help keep the existing infrastructure working, a integral component to making progress in remote communities.


Our challenge was give technicians access to that data in the best format possible.
In this app, we addressed the needs of local water pump engineers to bring the app with them to the field. They can view and get notified of the changes in health of the pumps, provide updates once they fix issues, navigate to other pumps, view the lay of the land, and do all of these with or without a data connection.

Key Features:

 - Log in with username and password
 - View list of pumps along with status and priority, location, distance from logged-in user, last updated time, etc.
 - View pumps on a map
 - Swipe between pumps on map view
 - Create a new report with a pump along with a new photo
 - Navigate to next pump after creating a report
 - View and communicate with other technicians in your area. 
 - Multiple Data fall-backs: data transfer will first attempt to be sent via data connection. If it fails, the data is parsed into a text message and sent to the server. If there is no cell service whatsoever, the data is cached.
